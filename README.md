This example project illustrates my solution for projectile trajectory calculation. The problem which it solves is: “What should be the initial velocity angle for a projectile to hit given coordinate?”.

I wrote a blog post about the details. Please refer the details and try online demo: [Projectile: initial velocity angle to hit coordinate.](http://www.n-created.com/2013/11/12/projectile-initial-velocity-angle-to-hit-coordinate/).
